    </div>
        <p>Hello, I am Matas Thanamee. My nickname is "Team," and I am 21 years old. I was born on June 12, 2002, and my zodiac sign is Gemini. I have blood type O, and I am a male with Thai nationality. I am the third child in my family, and I have 2 other brothers, all of us are male. I was born in Nan Province. My favorite colors are pink and blue. I have a fondness for penguin dolls and cars. In the future, I would like to own a specific car. I enjoy playing games with my friends, and my hobby is watching anime.
        </p>
    <div class="text-content">
        <p>If I have free time, consider playing sports such as baseball and swimming for the sake of good health. I am generally passionate about maintaining good health due to allergies, so it's essential to take good care of yourself. I also enjoy listening to various types of music, whether it's K-pop, J-pop, T-pop, rock, or rap.</p>
    <div class="text-content">
        <p>I have been interested in computers for a long time. When I had the opportunity, I took the exam. There were times when I was inattentive, and my grades dropped. However, now I am working on developing myself and paying close attention to my studies in class. I read the review book and work on every assignment in order to improve my overall average. I am committed to this endeavor.</p>
